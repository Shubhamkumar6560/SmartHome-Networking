# üè† SmartHome-Networking

#### üìå Project Overview
This project simulates a **smart home network** using **Cisco Packet Tracer**.  
It demonstrates how IoT devices like **smart lights, thermostats, IP cameras, and PCs** communicate in a home network with proper **IP addressing** and **routing**.

#### ‚ö° Features
- üí° Smart devices connected to a central router
- üåê IP addresses configured for all devices
- üõ°Ô∏è VLANs (optional) to separate device types for security
- üì∂ Internet access simulation for IoT devices
- üß∞ Network troubleshooting and simulation testing
- üîó Demonstrates device-to-device communication

#### üó∫Ô∏è IP Addressing Scheme
- **Router Gateway:** 192.168.1.1  
- **Subnet Mask:** 255.255.255.0  
- **DHCP Range:** 192.168.1.2 - 192.168.1.50  
- **VLANs (optional):**
  - VLAN 10: PCs
  - VLAN 20: Smart devices
  - VLAN 30: Security devices

#### üöÄ How to Use
1. Open **Cisco Packet Tracer**
2. Load the `.pkt` file in this repository
3. Observe network connectivity
4. Test communication between devices (ping, HTTP requests, etc.)
5. Modify IP addresses or devices to experiment with networking concepts

#### üõ†Ô∏è Tools Used
- Cisco Packet Tracer  
- Optional diagramming tools for exporting network images
